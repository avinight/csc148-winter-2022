(a) Answer (YES or NO):

    If yes, explain how, and if no, explain why not:
    Yes, assuming representation invariants are involved. Generally speaking,
    we assume that preconditions are True and upheld for the method's
    input. This changes how I would implement the method.
    If there were no preconditions, I would enforce restrictions within the
    method itself to not violate the representation invariants
    imposed on the class.

    However, assuming representation invariants are not involved
    would not impact my decision whether to enforce restrictions upon the code,
    since there is no reason to
    given that there are no preconditions.


(b) The docstring is:

    """Test that lst.extend() contains elements of new within it.
    """

    The function body is:
    lst.extend(new)
    for item in new:
        assert item in lst
