"""
Below is a Student class and its subclass, GraduateStudent.
These represent students in a record system like ACORN.

Read the docstring for Student, GraduateStudent, and their methods.

Your tasks are listed below.

    1.  Look at the if __name__ == '__main__' block.
        We have written some client code that *should* work. However, there
        is a bug. Your task is to find and fix the bug.

    2.  GraduateStudents must earn a grade of 70 or higher to earn credit for
        a course. Implement this change, but do NOT modify the complete_course
        method in the Student class.

        Run test_example() and make sure it passes on your revised code.
        If it does not pass, make sure:
            - You fixed the bug in Task 1
            - You did not modify Student.complete_course


Submit your code on MarkUs and run the automated self-test.
Your grade on the quiz will be based solely on the results of the self-test.
(i.e. if you pass all of the tests, you get full marks on the quiz.)
