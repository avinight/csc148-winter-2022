"""
Below is a set of functions and test cases. In this quiz, you will be
adjusting the test cases, and implementing one of the functions.

Your tasks are listed below.

    1. Read through the function fun1() and fill in the variables in
       test_fun1() as needed.

       You should be filling in either:
       - the variables expected_ages and expected_grades OR
       - the variable expected_error

       These should be filled in with what you would expect to happen if
       we ran the following code:
           ages = (4, 5, 6)
           grades = [10, 11]
           fun1(ages, grades)

    2. Read through the function fun2() and fill in the variables in
       test_fun2() as needed.

       You should be filling in either:
       - the variables expected_letters and expected_age OR
       - the variable expected_error

       These should be filled in with what you would expect to happen if
       we ran the following code:
            letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
            age = 6
            fun2(letters, age)

    You should be able to run pytest on test_fun1() and test_fun2() to see
    whether you have the correct results.

    3. Implement the function add_on()
       We've provided various options, but only one of them will work properly.
       You should delete all options that don't work.

    You should be able to run doctests on add_on to see if you've chosen
    the right option.

Submit your code on MarkUs and run the automated self-test.
Your grade on the quiz will be based solely on the results of the self-test.
(i.e. if you pass all of the tests, you get full marks on the quiz.)
