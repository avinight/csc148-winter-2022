"""
We've defined a Tree method for you to implement below named insert_child.
In this method, we've given you a basic sketch of the different scenarios
you'll need to consider.

Your tasks are listed below.
    1.      Implement the base case (when the Tree is empty).
    2.      Implement the case where self._root == parent
            (i.e. the case where we're inserting item to the Tree).
    3 + 4.  Implement the recursive case.
            There are two tasks here:
                - Task 3 is for correctly handling the case when item
                  is inserted into one of the subtrees.
                - Task 4 is for correctly handling the case when item is not
                  inserted into any of the subtrees.

You may not add any additional methods to Tree.

Submit your code on MarkUs and run the automated self-test.
Your grade on the quiz will be based solely on the results of the self-test.
(i.e. if you pass all of the tests, you get full marks on the quiz.)
