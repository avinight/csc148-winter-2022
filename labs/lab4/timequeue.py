# Task 3: Running timing experiments
#
# In this part of the lab, you will be conducting timing experiments on Queue
# operations.
#
# We have given you two types of Queues to experiment with:
#    AddToStartQueue:   This Queue uses a list and adds new elements to the
#                       start of the list, removing elements from the end.
#                       i.e. enqueue uses insert(0, item)
#                            dequeue uses pop()
#
#    AddToEndQueue:     This Queue also uses a list, but adds new elements to
#                       the end of the list, removing elements from the front.
#                       i.e. enqueue uses append(item)
#                            dequeue uses pop(0)
###############################################################################
# Experiment Parameters
# Below are our experiment settings: you may want to change these values.
#
# QUEUE_SIZES: This represents the queue sizes we'll be experimenting with.
#              i.e. enqueueing and dequeueing from Queues with size 10000,
#              20000, etc.
# NUM_TRIALS:  This represents the number of times we will repeat an
#              experiment: when we run our timing experiments, we want to get
#              use the average time over a number of trials in order to
#              minimize the effect of any outliers.
