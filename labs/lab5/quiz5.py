"""
Below is a bare-bones implementation of LinkedList and _Node with the method
insert_after.

Read the docstring for insert_after. Make sure you understand what it's supposed
to do.

Your tasks are listed below.
    1.  In the docstring of insert_after, fill in the expected result.
        This should be a string assigned to the provided variable 'expected'.

    2.  In the docstring of insert_after, fill in the actual result.
        This should be the result of the (currently buggy) implementation of
        insert_after.
        Once again, this should be a string assigned to the provided variable
        'actual'.

    3.  Fix the bug in insert_after.
        You should NOT use any other LinkedList methods -- use only what we've
        provided in quiz5.py

After you finish Task (1) and (3), you should be able to run and pass
the doctests.

Submit your code on MarkUs and run the automated self-test.
Your grade on the quiz will be based solely on the results of the self-test.
(i.e. if you pass all of the tests, you get full marks on the quiz.)
