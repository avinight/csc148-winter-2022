"""
Below is a Tournament class that records game outcomes and reports statistics.

Read the docstring for Tournament and its methods.

Your tasks are listed below.
Note: record_game is not implemented yet, so you won't be able to run
      the sample usage until after task 4.

    1.  Look at the Sample usage in Tournament.
        A precondition is violated within the sample usage.
        Fix the sample usage so that no preconditions are violated.
        Only one line in the sample usage should be changed.

    2. For Task 1, did you need to know how the instance attributes worked
       in order to identify the violated precondition?
       Write your answer in the space labelled <your answer here>.
       The answer itself won't be graded, but we will check that you wrote
       an answer.


       <Yes, since the attribute teams does not instantiate a Team C.>


    3.  At the end of the sample usage, add another example that calls:
            t.team_stats

        Write down the expected value of t.team_stats.
        If you're unsure of what team_stats is, read the documentation about
        Tournament's attributes.

    4.  Implement the method record_game.
        We have included some comments to help guide you.
        At this point, you should be able to run the doctests.

    5.  test_multiple_teams() is a test case that should pass. There is no
        bug within it, but there is one within Tournament.__init__

        Find the bug in Tournament.__init__ and fix it.
        It may help to draw a memory model diagram to understand where the
        bug is.

Submit your code on MarkUs and run the automated self-test.
Your grade on the quiz will be based solely on the results of the self-test.
(i.e. if you pass all of the tests, you get full marks on the quiz.)
