=== Module description ===
This module contains sample tests for Prep 4. You may use these to test your
code.

Complete the TODO in this file.

When writing a test case, make sure you create a new function, with its
name starting with "test_". For example:

def test_my_test_case():
    # Your test here
"""
from typing import List

from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis.strategies import integers, lists

from adts import Stack, Queue
from prep4 import peek, reverse_top_two, remove_all, remove_all_but_one, \
     add_in_order


################################################################################
# Part 2
# In prep4.py, we have given you the buggy function add_in_order().
# While the documentation of this function is correct, the implementation is
# not.
#
# Write a test case that will fail this buggy implementation, but pass on a
# working version of add_in_order().
#
# You should run the provided self-test on MarkUs to see whether your test
# correctly meets the requirements.
################################################################################
# TODO: Implement at least 1 test case for add_in_order() that will
#       fail on the provided (buggy) implementation but pass on a correct
#       implementation.

# Below are provided sample test cases for your use. You are encouraged
# to add additional test cases, but you are not required to do so.
#
# WARNING: THIS IS AN EXTREMELY INCOMPLETE SET OF TESTS!
# You may add your own to practice writing tests and to be confident
# your code is correct.
