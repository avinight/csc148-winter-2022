This module contains the code for a linked list implementation with two classes,
LinkedList and _Node.

    # double underscores), and enable some special Python behaviour that we've
    # illustrated in the doctests.

    # At the bottom of this file, we've included some helpers
    # to create some basic linked lists for our doctests.
