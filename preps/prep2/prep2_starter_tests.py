=== Module Description ===
This module contains sample tests for Prep 2.
Complete the TODO in this file.
There is also a task inside prep2.py.
Make sure to look at that file and complete the TODO there as well.

We suggest you also add your own tests to practice writing tests and
to be confident your code is correct.

When writing a test case, make sure you create a new function, with its
name starting with "test_". For example:

def test_my_test_case():
    # Your test here

All test cases must have different names (i.e. you cannot have two tests
named test_my_test_case).
