=== Module description ===
This module contains sample tests for Prep 3.
Complete the TODO in this file.

There is also a task inside prep3.py.
Make sure to look at that file and complete the TODO there as well.

When writing a test case, make sure you create a new function, with its
name starting with "test_". For example:

def test_my_test_case():
    # Your test here
"""
from datetime import date
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis.strategies import integers, floats
from prep3 import SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, Company


################################################################################
# Part 3
# In this part, you will be writing your own test cases from scratch.
# You must implement *at least* 2 more test cases to test your code.
#
# These test cases must be in their own functions, their names must start
# with "test_", and the test names must be unique.
#
# These test cases must pass on a working version of the prep3 code
# (i.e. a working version of SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, Company) and
# must create at least one SalariedEmployee or HourlyEmployee.
#
# You must NOT access any private variables.
#
# There are no other requirements for the test cases.
#
# You can verify whether your test cases are acceptable by running the
# automated tests on MarkUs.

# Use the below test cases as an example for writing your own test cases,
