=== Module Description ===
This module contains an illustration of *inheritance* through an abstract
Employee class that defines a common interface for all of its subclasses.

As usual, delete the TODO comments after you've completed each part.

There is also a task inside prep3_starter_tests.py.
Make sure to look at that file and complete the TODO there as well.

# Part 1
# In this part of the prep, you will implement the total_pay method of the
# Employee class.
#
# You may add new PRIVATE instance attributes to the class if needed.
#
# Private instance attributes are attributes whose names start with _ and
# should not be accessed by code outside of the class.
#
# Document any new attributes in your class docstring, include type
# annotations for them, and make sure you initialize them properly.
#
# You CAN (and should) modify the bodies of the provided methods, but you
# must NOT modify the method headers.
#
# You may assume as a precondition that the pay method is not called on the
# same employee twice in the same month.
#
# Remember: 'precondition' here means that your implementation can assume this
# is true, and you do not need to check for it!
