    """A university course.

    === Instance Attributes ===
    name: the name of this course.
    cap: The enrolment cap for this course, i.e., the maximum number of
        students who may enrol.

    === Private Attributes ===
    _scheme:
        The marking scheme for this course.  Each key is an element of the
        course, and its value is the weight of that element towards the
        course grade.
    _grades:
        The grades earned so far in this course.  Each key is a student
        ID and its value is a dict mapping a course element to the student's
        mark on that element.  If a student did not submit that element,
        it does not appear as a key in the student's dict.  If, however,
        they earned a grade of zero, this is recorded as any other grade
        would be.

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - The sum of all weights in _scheme must be 100.
    - Each key in every student's dict of grades must be an element of the
      course grading scheme, i.e., must occur as a key in _scheme.
